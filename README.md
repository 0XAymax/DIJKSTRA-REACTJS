## Intelligent Tutoring System for Dijkstra's Algorithm

An interactive web-based tutoring system that helps students learn and visualize Dijkstra's algorithm step by step.

## 🚀 Features
- Interactive graph input and visualization
- Step-by-step explanation of Dijkstra's algorithm
- Performance feedback and adaptive hints
- User authentication and progress tracking

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Deployment**: Heroku, Vercel

## 🧠 How It Works
1. Students go through a course with a chatbot to help them if they get stuck or need a question answered.
2. The system walks them through each step of Dijkstra's algorithm, and corrects the user if they get a question wrong.
3. It gives feedback, tracks progress, and adapts based on user input.
